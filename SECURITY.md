## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities in the [Issues](https://github.com/groboclown/grackle-zero/issues) section of the GitHub project.  If the vulnerability allows for in-the-wild exposure, please mark the issue as such, and a project representative will reach out to your GitHub account for ways to transfer information securely.

As this project aims to provide a secure execution environment for potential malicious code, we take security seriously.

## Reporting a Limitation

While this project aims to make as tight of a sandbox environment as possible without launching a VM, the different execution platforms impose their own set of limitations for restrictions, which may not impose as tight of restrictions as intended.

If you find an additional limitation, please also include this as an [issue](https://github.com/groboclown/grackle-zero/issues).  The resolution for the issue will end up as further documentation.
